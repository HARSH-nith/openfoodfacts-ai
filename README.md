# openfoodfacts-ai

# Before you read on
* This repository is to track and store all our experimental AI endeavours, and wishlists. 
* The [Robotoff repo](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff) is the place to integrate them into production, and file more trivial issues.

# README
* [Nutrition table detection and extraction (2018 GSoc work by Sagar) - integrated in Robotoff, used for the detection part by the Graphnet and TableNet models](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ai/tree/develop/GSoC2018/table_detection)
* [EM Lyon Category prediction (2020) - not yet evaluated and integrated](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ai/blob/develop/ai-emlyon/README.md)
* [Google.org fellowship (2021) - Category prediction based on ingredients and title](https://github.com/kulizhsy/off-category-classification/)
* [Labels and Logo detection (Data 4 Good, by Raphael, Charlotte and Antoine, code is duplicated and integrated in Robotoff](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ai/blob/develop/data4good_logo_detection/README.md)
* [Nutrition Table Extraction (2020 by Sadok, Yichen and Ramzi, on Graphnet and TableNet)](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ai/blob/develop/nutrition-table-extraction/data_exploration/README.md)
